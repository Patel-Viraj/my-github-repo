<pre><p> In 2006, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure
    services to businesses in the form of web services, now commonly known as cloud
    computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front
    capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the
    cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure
    weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of
    servers in minutes and deliver results faster.

<p>
    Today, AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable, and low-cost infrastructure platform in the
    cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in more than 190 countries around
    the world.

    This chapter provides an introduction to the AWS Cloud computing platform. It discusses the
    advantages of cloud computing and the fundamentals of AWS. It provides an overview of the
    AWS Cloud services that are fundamentally important for the exam.
